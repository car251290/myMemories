# myMemories
My memories is one project to learn full stack use backend,FrontEnd and React code using the react envarioment for my code to be styles and wirte it in JS 

## Terminology
MERN Stack

## Memories Application to use front end and the back end part
using the frond end in React and node.js for the back end part

## MongoDB Atlas
Move faster with a true multi-cloud database service for MongoDB built for agile teams whoâ€™d rather spend time building apps than managing databases.
only globally distributed, multi-cloud database. Deploy your data across 70+ regions or create a multi-cloud cluster to enable applications that make use of two or more clouds at the same time.

## Collection have documents or objects and documents looks like JSON objects
## inside each document you have the data with key-value pairs or arrays of items.

## Automated Deployments
Infrastructure provisioning, setup, and deployment is fully automated with MongoDB Atlas. Select a cloud provider, region, instance size, memory, and additional configurations in the Cluster Builder or via the API and be on your way.

## HTTP Status Codes
This page is created from HTTP status code information found at ietf.org and Wikipedia.

Let's imagine we wouldn't just return a result, as we do at the moment, but would act properly on the received operation instead. For instance, the Express server could be connected to a database that stores user entities in a user table. Now, when consuming the REST API as a client (e.g. cURL, browser, or also a React.js application), you could retrieve all users from the database with a HTTP GET method on the /users URI or, on the same resource, create a new user with a HTTP POST method.

## Using a React envarioment 

Component-Based

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
and using element as Cards made for the Material UI for give a smooth presentation

## Material UI for the style of this APP

it useful to builded and deploy it on an easy way to make it.

## Hooks 

React's new "hooks" APIs give function components the ability to use local component state, execute side effects, and more.

React Redux now offers a set of hook APIs as an alternative to the existing connect() Higher Order Component. These APIs allow you to subscribe to the Redux store and dispatch actions, without having to wrap your components in connect().

 The selector will be called with the entire Redux store state as its only argument. The selector will be run whenever the function component renders (unless its reference hasn't changed since a previous render of the component so that a cached result can be returned by the hook without re-running the selector). useSelector() will also subscribe to the Redux store, and run your selector whenever an action is dispatched.

## Working in post using HEROKU

Data on Heroku
Build data-driven apps where the store of the back end of the app will be laungched and give the opportunity to watch it with out running in the local host. working in this learning how to launch the APP

## For the Front end using Netlify.js
Using this great JS platform, launch the Back End where will be visual and use an URL of the project

# Language 
React(JS)

# Requirements
* Visual Studio
* MongoDb
* Netlify
* Heroku (deploy application)
* Material UI (for the design in mobile device and responsive application)
