# myMemories
My memories is one project to learn full stack use backend,FrontEnd and React envarioment for my code to be styles and wirte it in JS 

## Memories Application to use front end and the back end part
using the frond end in React and node.js for the back end part

## MongoDb
MongoDB Atlas comes with built-in operational best practices so you can focus on delivering business value and accelerating application development instead of managing databases,the Cluster Builder or via the API and be on your way.

## Automated Deployments
Infrastructure provisioning, setup, and deployment is fully automated with MongoDB Atlas. Select a cloud provider, region, instance size, memory, and additional configurations in the Cluster Builder or via the API and be on your way.

## HTTP Status Codes
This page is created from HTTP status code information found at ietf.org and Wikipedia. 
Click on the category heading or the status code link to read more.

## Netlify
Build scalable,
dynamic applications
Deploy server-side code that works as API endpoints, runs automatically in response to events, or processes more complex jobs in the background.
Netlify is a web developer platform that multiplies productivity. By unifying the elements of the modern decoupled web, from local development to advanced edge logic, Netlify enables a 10x faster path to much more performant, secure, and scalable websites and apps.

## Component-Based

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
and using element as Cards made for the Material UI for give a smooth presentation

## Material UI for the style of this APP

it useful to builded and deploy it on an easy way to make it.

## Hooks 
React's new "hooks" APIs give function components the ability to use local component state, execute side effects, and more.

React Redux now offers a set of hook APIs as an alternative to the existing connect() Higher Order Component. These APIs allow you to subscribe to the Redux store and dispatch actions, without having to wrap your components in connect().

 The selector will be called with the entire Redux store state as its only argument. The selector will be run whenever the function component renders (unless its reference hasn't changed since a previous render of the component so that a cached result can be returned by the hook without re-running the selector). useSelector() will also subscribe to the Redux store, and run your selector whenever an action is dispatched.
 
 ## Node.js

 HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.

 ## Hook callbacks

Key events in the lifetime of asynchronous events have been categorized into four areas: instantiation, before/after the callback is called, and when the instance is destroyed.

init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource)#

asyncId <number> A unique ID for the async resource.
type <string> The type of the async resource.
triggerAsyncId <number> The unique ID of the async resource in whose execution context this async resource was created.
resource <Object> Reference to the resource representing the async operation, needs to be released during destroy.
 
 
## For the Front end using Netlify.js
Using this great JS platform, launch the Back End where will be visual and use an URL of the project

## Using Heroku can be available for everyone
Data on Heroku
Build data-driven apps where the store of the back end of the app will be laungched and give the opportunity to watch it with out running in the local host. working in this learning how to launch the APP
